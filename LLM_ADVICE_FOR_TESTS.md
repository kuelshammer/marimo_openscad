# Action Plan: Elevating Test Quality for `marimo_openscad`

**Objective:** This document provides a comprehensive plan to upgrade the testing suite for the `kuelshammer/marimo_openscad` repository from its current "Good" state to "Very High Quality."

**Target Audience:** An AI assistant or developer tasked with implementing these changes.

## 1. Current State Analysis

The project's current testing landscape has significant strengths but also a critical gap.

| Component                 | Tooling                  | Quality         | Assessment                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python Backend**        | `pytest`                 | **High**        | Well-structured tests covering core logic, initialization, and error handling. Uses modern, standard tooling.                                   |
| **JavaScript Frontend**   | N/A                      | **Non-existent**| **This is the primary area for improvement.** All user-facing interactive logic is currently untested, posing a risk of UI/UX regressions.      |
| **CI / Code Quality**     | GitHub Actions, `ruff`   | **Very High**   | Excellent automation. Runs tests against multiple Python versions. Enforces linting and formatting, ensuring high code quality and consistency. |

## 2. High-Level Improvement Strategy

To achieve "Very High Quality" status, we will execute the following plan in order of priority:

1.  **Priority 1: Implement Frontend JavaScript Testing.** Introduce unit and integration tests for the JavaScript frontend using `Vitest` to validate the core interactive logic.
2.  **Priority 2: Enhance Python Test Coverage Reporting.** Integrate `pytest-cov` to measure and enforce test coverage for the Python backend, ensuring no code is left untested.
3.  **Future Goal: Introduce End-to-End (E2E) Testing.** (Optional but recommended for gold-standard quality) Add E2E tests using `Playwright` to simulate real user interaction in a live Marimo environment.

## 3. Detailed Implementation Steps

### Priority 1: Implement Frontend JavaScript Testing with `Vitest`

This is the most critical task. We will add `Vitest` to the `frontend` package to test the component's interactive logic.

#### Step 1: Update Frontend Dependencies

Modify `frontend/package.json` to add `vitest` and `jsdom` as development dependencies. Also, add a `test` script.

```json
// frontend/package.json

{
  "name": "marimo-openscad-frontend",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "test": "vitest" // <-- ADD THIS LINE
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.2.2",
    "vite": "^5.2.0",
    "vitest": "^1.6.0", // <-- ADD THIS LINE
    "jsdom": "^24.0.0"   // <-- ADD THIS LINE
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure Vitest

Create a new file `frontend/vitest.config.ts` to configure the test environment.

```typescript
// frontend/vitest.config.ts

/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    // Use jsdom to simulate a browser environment in Node.js
    environment: 'jsdom',
  },
});
```

#### Step 3: Write Initial Tests

Create a test file `frontend/src/tests/index.test.ts`. This test will mock the `marimo` and OpenJSCAD `viewer` objects to verify that our main function correctly interacts with them.

```typescript
// frontend/src/tests/index.test.ts

import { describe, it, expect, vi } from "vitest";
import { MarimoOpenSCAD } from "../index";

// Mock the global marimo object and its methods
const mockMarimo = {
  callBack: vi.fn(),
};
vi.stubGlobal("marimo", mockMarimo);

// Mock the OpenJSCAD viewer constructor and its methods
const mockViewer = {
  load: vi.fn(),
  clear: vi.fn(),
};
vi.stubGlobal("OpenJsCad", {
  Viewer: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => mockViewer),
});

describe("MarimoOpenSCAD", () => {
  it("should initialize with initial SCAD code", () => {
    const initialCode = "cube(10);";
    const element = document.createElement("div");

    // Instantiate the class
    new MarimoOpenSCAD(element, initialCode);

    // Assert that the viewer was created with the correct element
    expect(OpenJsCad.Viewer).toHaveBeenCalledWith(element);
    
    // Assert that the viewer was instructed to load the initial code
    expect(mockViewer.load).toHaveBeenCalledWith(".scad", initialCode, "main.scad");
  });

  it("should send code back to the kernel on editor change", async () => {
    const initialCode = "";
    const element = document.createElement("div");
    const editorElement = document.createElement("div");
    element.appendChild(editorElement);

    // Mock the editor creation logic
    vi.spyOn(document, 'querySelector').mockReturnValue(editorElement);
    
    // Create an instance of our class
    const instance = new MarimoOpenSCAD(element, initialCode);
    
    // Simulate the editor's update listener being called
    const newCode = "sphere(5);";
    // Directly call the debounced function's internal callback for the test
    instance.handleEditorChange(newCode);

    // Assert that the `set_scad_code` callback was sent to the kernel
    expect(mockMarimo.callBack).toHaveBeenCalledWith("set_scad_code", [newCode]);
  });
});
```

#### Step 4: Update CI to Run Frontend Tests

Modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to install Node.js/pnpm and run the new tests.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml

name: CI

# ... (on: ... trigger)

jobs:
  test:
    name: Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} on ${{ matrix.os }}
    # ... (runs-on, strategy matrix)

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      # ... (Install dependencies, Lint, Format steps remain the same)

      # --- START NEW STEPS FOR FRONTEND ---
      - name: Install pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 9

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm'
          cache-dependency-path: 'frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml'

      - name: Install frontend dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
        working-directory: ./frontend

      - name: Run frontend tests
        run: pnpm test
        working-directory: ./frontend
      # --- END NEW STEPS FOR FRONTEND ---

      - name: Run python tests
        run: |
          pip install .[test]
          pytest
```

---

### Priority 2: Enhance Python Test Coverage

This task improves the existing Python tests by adding coverage measurement and enforcement.

#### Step 1: Add `pytest-cov` Dependency

Modify `pyproject.toml` to include `pytest-cov`.

```toml
# pyproject.toml

[project.optional-dependencies]
test = [
    "pytest",
    "pytest-cov"  # <-- ADD THIS LINE
]
```

#### Step 2: Update CI to Run with Coverage

Modify the "Run python tests" step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to collect coverage and fail if it's below a threshold (e.g., 95%).

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (inside the jobs:test:steps block)

      - name: Run python tests
        run: |
          pip install .[test]
          pytest \
            --cov=marimo_openscad \
            --cov-report=term-missing \
            --cov-fail-under=95
```
*   `--cov=marimo_openscad`: Specifies the package to measure coverage for.
*   `--cov-report=term-missing`: Shows which lines are not covered directly in the terminal log.
*   `--cov-fail-under=95`: Causes the CI step to fail if test coverage is less than 95%.

### Future Goal: Introduce End-to-End (E2E) Testing

This provides the ultimate confidence by testing the component within a real Marimo notebook.

#### Suggested Tool: `Playwright`

`Playwright` is an excellent choice due to its robust Python API.

#### E2E Test Concept (Pseudocode)

An E2E test would involve the following steps, likely in a separate test file under the `tests/` directory (e.g., `tests/test_e2e.py`):

1.  **Programmatically run a Marimo notebook** containing the OpenSCAD component.
2.  **Use Playwright to connect to the browser** instance serving the notebook.
3.  **Locate the OpenSCAD component** on the page.
4.  **Find the CodeMirror editor** element within the component.
5.  **Simulate user input:** `page.locator('.cm-content').fill('sphere(20);')`.
6.  **Wait for the UI to update.** This involves waiting for the debounce timer and the re-render. A good strategy is to wait for a specific element in the `OpenJsCad.Viewer` canvas to appear or change.
7.  **Take a screenshot** of the viewer canvas: `page.locator('.jscad-viewer').screenshot(path='test-output.png')`.
8.  **Perform visual regression testing** by comparing the screenshot against a known "golden" image. Libraries like `pytest-playwright-snapshot` can automate this.

By completing Priority 1 and 2, the `marimo_openscad` project will have a very high-quality, full-stack test suite that provides strong guarantees about the correctness and stability of both its backend and frontend logic.
